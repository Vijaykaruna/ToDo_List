# TODO LIST

 A TODO list built with MERN stack manages tasks using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js for full-stack CRUD functionality.
## Features
- Create, Read and Delete tasks
- All the tasks are stored in database
- Login to see all details
## Get Started
This repository aims to assist you in beginning work on a MERN stack application with a solid file structure as a foundation. To get started make a copy of this template repo for your project teams.

Since this project will hold both the frontend application and the backend application there will be node modules in two different places. First run `npm install` from the root. From now on run this command anytime you want to install all modules again. This is a script we have defined in package.json .

This app can be deployed directly to the package.json which will automatically handle building and deploying the app. For more information on deploying or any reference the extra resources at the bottom of this file.
## Installation 
In the project directory, you can run:

- Frontend
  ``` 
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
- Backend
  *open new terminal*
```
   cd backend
   npm start
```
